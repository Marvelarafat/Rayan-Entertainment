 <b>Why Do Most Programmers not participating In Relationships?</b>
<br/>
 According to research made by me, Most of the Programmers end breaking up in relationships
 <br> with there Girl Friends,Boy Friends, Husbands and Wives
<br> and when it comes to boys many of them donot know how to flirt with girls.</br>
 This has been caused due to the following;
 <ul>
  <li>Programmers spend much time on there codes rather than there loved ones</br>
 and this is one of the main factors why they are just Bad guys for now.
 </li>
 <li>They offer much attention to there people whenever they ask them about there projects
  but when it comes to other affairs they really contribute less.
</li>
<li>
 Mainly Programmers are good in speaking there annoyingful coding language during conversations</br>
 and this is the reason why they hate them most.
  </br>Thats to say Your talking about your first date and He/She is talking about the difference between JavaScript and Java.</br>
Your asking a Programmer about his/her Hobbies and endsup saying "I really like working with C++"</br>
Questioning him/her about what there wishes and responds"I wish onetime i Master the Python" and you endup </br>
in fears thinking is talking about a snake.
</li>
